# Data-Analysis-on-Employment-for-the-Office-of-Global-Michigan
This project is to analyze the data about refugee employment for the Office of Global Michigan. The overarching goal of the project is to use the existing data to find any trend of employment and how the organization could impact over 1000 refugees. 

### Background
The mission of the Office of Global Michigan is to empower and engage the immigrant, refugee, and international community to make Michigan the home for the opportunity. Global Michigan's Refugee Services program contracts with various non-profit and local agencies to provide social services to help people start over, become self-sufficient, and integrate with their new community. Employability services include job development, job placement, family and individual employability plan, English language training, professional and skills recertification, transportation services, etc. 

This project first aims to understand the current status of employment for the refugees in Michigan. It also analyzed the importance of the employment services offered by the Office of Global Michigan through different charts. 

This project is conducted by a group of students from the School of Information at the University of Michigan during the winter semester of 2020. The members of the group include team manager Christina Li, a BSI junior, Jing Cao, a 1st year MSI student, and Di Jin, a 1st year MSI student.

### Method
We used the Python3 pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries to clean, analyze and visualize the data. We were provided with eight excel sheets covering Michigan refugee data across twelve counties in 2019. Along with data, we also did some outside research to support/testify our assumptions. At last, we applied matplotlib and seaborn to the cleaned data in order to visualize our findings.

### Main Findings
All the findings are written in our final report. Please contact cgli@umich.edu, jingcao@umich.edu or jindi@umich.edu for a full report.
